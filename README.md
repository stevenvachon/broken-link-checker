## Installation

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) `>= 12` is required. There're two ways to use it:

### Command Line Usage
To install, type this at the command line:
```shell
npm install broken-link-checker -g
```
After that, check out the help for available options:
```shell
blc --help
```
A typical site-wide check might look like:
```shell
blc http://yoursite.com -ro
```

### Programmatic API
To install, type this at the command line:
```shell
npm install broken-link-checker
```
The remainder of this document will assist you in using the API.


## Classes
While all classes have been exposed for custom use, the one that you need will most likely be [`SiteChecker`](#sitechecker).

### `HtmlChecker`
Scans an HTML document to find broken links. All methods from [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) are available.

```js
const {HtmlChecker} = require('broken-link-checker');

const htmlChecker = new HtmlChecker(options)
  .on('error', (error) => {})
  .on('html', (tree, robots) => {})
  .on('queue', () => {})
  .on('junk', (result) => {})
  .on('link', (result) => {})
  .on('complete', () => {});

htmlChecker.scan(html, baseURL);
```

#### Methods & Properties
* `.clearCache()` will remove any cached URL responses.
* `.isPaused` returns `true` if the internal link queue is paused and `false` if not.
* `.numActiveLinks` returns the number of links with active requests.
* `.numQueuedLinks` returns the number of links that currently have no active requests.
* `.pause()` will pause the internal link queue, but will not pause any active requests.
* `.resume()` will resume the internal link queue.
* `.scan(html, baseURL)` parses & scans a single HTML document and returns a `Promise`. Calling this function while a previous scan is in progress will result in a thrown error. Arguments:
  * `html` must be either a [`Stream`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) or a string.
  * `baseURL` must be a [`URL`](https://mdn.io/URL). Without this value, links to relative URLs will output a "BLC_INVALID" error (unless an absolute `<base href>` is found).

#### Events
* `'complete'` is emitted after the last result or zero results.
* `'error'` is emitted when an error occurs within any of your event handlers and will prevent the current scan from failing. Arguments:
  * `error` is the `Error`.
* `'html'` is emitted after the HTML document has been fully parsed. Arguments:
  * `tree` is supplied by [parse5](https://npmjs.com/parse5).
  * `robots` is an instance of [robot-directives](https://npmjs.com/robot-directives) containing any `<meta>` robot exclusions.
* `'junk'` is emitted on each skipped/unchecked link, as configured in options. Arguments:
  * `result` is a [`Link`](https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker/blob/master/lib/internal/Link.js).
* `'link'` is emitted with the result of each checked/unskipped link (broken or not). Arguments:
  * `result` is a [`Link`](https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker/blob/master/lib/internal/Link.js).
* `'queue'` is emitted when a link is internally queued, dequeued or made active.

## Options

### `acceptedSchemes`
Type: `Array`  
Default value: `['http:','https:']`  
Will only check links with schemes/protocols mentioned in this list. Any others (except those in `excludedSchemes`) will output an "Invalid URL" error.

### `cacheMaxAge`
Type: `Number`  
Default Value: `3_600_000` (1 hour)  
The number of milliseconds in which a cached response should be considered valid. This is only relevant if the `cacheResponses` option is enabled.

### `cacheResponses`
Type: `Boolean`  
Default Value: `true`  
URL request results will be cached when `true`. This will ensure that each unique URL will only be checked once.

### `customFilter`
Type: `Function`  
Default value: `link => true`  
A synchronous callback that is called after all other filters have been performed. Return `true` to include `link` (a [`Link`](https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker/blob/master/lib/internal/Link.js)) in the list of links to be checked, or return `false` to have it skipped.

This option does *not* apply to `UrlChecker`.

### `excludedKeywords`
Type: `Array`  
Default value: `[]`  
A blacklist. Will not check links that match the keywords and glob patterns in this list. The only wildcards supported are [`*` and `!`](https://npmjs.com/matcher).

This option does *not* apply to `UrlChecker`.

### `excludedSchemes`
Type: `Array`  
Default value: `['data:','geo:','javascript:','mailto:','sms:','tel:']`  
Will not check links with schemes/protocols mentioned in this list. This avoids the output of "Invalid URL" errors with links that cannot be checked.

This option does *not* apply to `UrlChecker`.

### `excludeExternalLinks`
Type: `Boolean`  
Default value: `false`  
Will not check external links (different protocol and/or host) when `true`; relative links with a remote `<base href>` included.

This option does *not* apply to `UrlChecker`.

### `excludeInternalLinks`
Type: `Boolean`  
Default value: `false`  
Will not check internal links (same protocol and host) when `true`.

This option does *not* apply to `UrlChecker` nor `SiteChecker`'s *crawler*.

### `excludeLinksToSamePage`
Type: `Boolean`  
Default value: `false`  
Will not check links to the same page; relative and absolute fragments/hashes included. This is only relevant if the `cacheResponses` option is disabled.

This option does *not* apply to `UrlChecker`.

### `filterLevel`
Type: `Number`  
Default value: `1`  
The tags and attributes that are considered links for checking, split into the following levels:
* `0`: clickable links
* `1`: clickable links, media, frames, meta refreshes
* `2`: clickable links, media, frames, meta refreshes, stylesheets, scripts, forms
* `3`: clickable links, media, frames, meta refreshes, stylesheets, scripts, forms, metadata

Recursive links have a slightly different filter subset. To see the exact breakdown of both, check out the [tag map](https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker/blob/master/lib/internal/tags.js). `<base href>` is not listed because it is not a link, though it is always parsed.

This option does *not* apply to `UrlChecker`.

### `honorRobotExclusions`
Type: `Boolean`  
Default value: `true`  
Will not scan pages that search engine crawlers would not follow. Such will have been specified with any of the following:
* `<a rel="nofollow" href="‚Ä¶">`
* `<area rel="nofollow" href="‚Ä¶">`
* `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow,‚Ä¶">`
* `<meta name="googlebot" content="noindex,nofollow,‚Ä¶">`
* `<meta name="robots" content="unavailable_after: ‚Ä¶">`
* `X-Robots-Tag: noindex,nofollow,‚Ä¶`
* `X-Robots-Tag: googlebot: noindex,nofollow,‚Ä¶`
* `X-Robots-Tag: otherbot: noindex,nofollow,‚Ä¶`
* `X-Robots-Tag: unavailable_after: ‚Ä¶`
* robots.txt

This option does *not* apply to `UrlChecker`.

### `includedKeywords`
Type: `Array`  
Default value: `[]`  
A whitelist. Will only check links that match the keywords and glob patterns in this list, if any. The only wildcard supported is `*`.

This option does *not* apply to `UrlChecker`.

### `maxSockets`
Type: `Number`  
Default value: `Infinity`  
The maximum number of links to check at any given time.

### `maxSocketsPerHost`
Type: `Number`  
Default value: `2`  
The maximum number of links per host/port to check at any given time. This avoids overloading a single target host with too many concurrent requests. This will not limit concurrent requests to other hosts.

### `rateLimit`
Type: `Number`  
Default value: `0`  
The number of milliseconds to wait before each request.

### `requestMethod`
Type: `String`  
Default value: `'head'`  
The HTTP request method used in checking links. If you experience problems, try using `'get'`, however the `retryHeadFail` option should have you covered.

### `retryHeadCodes`
Type: `Array`  
Default value: `[405]`  
The list of HTTP status codes for the `retryHeadFail` option to reference.

### `retryHeadFail`
Type: `Boolean`  
Default value: `true`  
Some servers do not respond correctly to a `'head'` request method. When `true`, a link resulting in an HTTP status code listed within the `retryHeadCodes` option will be re-requested using a `'get'` method before deciding that it is broken. This is only relevant if the `requestMethod` option is set to `'head'`.

### `userAgent`
Type: `String`  
Default value: `'broken-link-checker/0.8.0 Node.js/8.9.4 (OS X; x64)'` (or similar)  
The HTTP user-agent to use when checking links as well as retrieving pages and robot exclusions.


## Handling Broken/Excluded Links
A broken link will have an `isBroken` value of `true` and a reason code defined in `brokenReason`. A link that was not checked (emitted as `'junk'`) will have an `wasExcluded` value of `true` and a reason code defined in `excludedReason`.
```js
if (link.isBroken) {
  console.log(link.brokenReason);
  //-> HTTP_406
} else if (link.wasExcluded) {
  console.log(link.excludedReason);
  //-> BLC_ROBOTS
}
```

Additionally, more descriptive messages are available for each reason code:
```js
const blc = require('broken-link-checker');

console.log(blc.reasons.BLC_ROBOTS);       //-> Robots Exclusion
console.log(blc.reasons.ERRNO_ECONNRESET); //-> connection reset by peer (ECONNRESET)
console.log(blc.reasons.HTTP_404);         //-> Not Found (404)

// List all
console.log(blc.reasons);
```

Putting it all together:
```js
if (link.isBroken) {
  console.log(blc.reasons[link.brokenReason]);
} else if (link.wasExcluded) {
  console.log(blc.reasons[link.excludedReason]);
}
```


## Roadmap Features
* `'info'` event with messaging such as 'Site does not support HTTP HEAD method' (regarding `retryHeadFail` option)
* add cheerio support by using parse5's htmlparser2 tree adaptor?
* load sitemap.xml at *start* of each `SiteChecker` site (since cache can expire) to possibly check pages that were not linked to, removing from list as *discovered* links are checked
* remove `options.excludedSchemes` and handle schemes not in `options.acceptedSchemes` as junk?
* change order of checking to: tcp error, 4xx code (broken), 5xx code (undetermined), 200
* abort download of body when `options.retryHeadFail===true`
* option to retry broken links a number of times (default=0)
* option to scrape `response.body` for erroneous sounding text (using [fathom](https://npmjs.com/fathom-web)?), since an error page could be presented but still have code 200
* option to detect parked domain (302 with no redirect?)
* option to check broken link on archive.org for archived version (using [this lib](https://npmjs.com/archive.org))

* supply CORS error for file:// links on sites with a different protocol
* create an example with http://astexplorer.net
* swap [calmcard](https://npmjs.com/calmcard) for [matcher](https://npmjs.com/matcher) or both [minimatch](https://npmjs.com/minimatch) and `RegExp`
